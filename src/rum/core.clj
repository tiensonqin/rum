     3. Takes render function and mixins, builds React class from them
     4. Using that class, generates constructor fn [args]->ReactElement
     5. Defines top-level var with provided name and assigns ctor to it

   Usage:

   ```
   (rum/defc label < rum/static [t]
     [:div t])

   ;; creates React class
   ;; adds mixin rum/static
   ;; defines ctor fn (defn label [t] ...) => element

                - `reset!` result of `f` to the sink atom.

             Example:

             - `opts` - optional. Map of:
               - `:ref` - use this as sink ref. By default creates new atom,
               - `:check-equals?` - Defaults to `true`. If equality check should be run on each source update: `(= @sink (f new-vals))`. When result of recalculating `f` equals to the old value, `reset!` won’t be called. Set to `false` if checking for equality can be expensive."}
